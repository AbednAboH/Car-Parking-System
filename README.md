# CSP system :
* This project is a Car Parking System that allows costumers to :
  ** subscribe to a monthly subscription
  ** order a spot in a specific parking lot before hand 
  ** this project also manages how the cars are inserted/extracted to the parking lot 
  ** supports multiple parking lots and multiple costumers 
  ** allows useres that are not registered in the system to look at a cataloge that describes the parking lot fees and available parking lots in the whole country 
  ** a robust and new way to manage parking lots with time based system 


* first steps were to create a data base :
      ** used an azure server to implement a MySQL data base 
      ** we used UML language to desighn the strucure of the project (skelaton) that described a 3 tier system :
          ** Entity : holds all the data of an entity 
          ** Control : holds all function that are communication based 
          ** Boundary : A Gui for each user
