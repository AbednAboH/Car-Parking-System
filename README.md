# CPS system :
* This project is a Car Parking System that allows costumers to :
  * subscribe to a monthly subscription
  * order a spot in a specific parking lot before hand 
  * this project also manages how the cars are inserted/extracted to the parking lot 
  * supports multiple parking lots and multiple costumers 
  * allows useres that are not registered in the system to look at a cataloge that describes the parking lot fees and available parking lots in the whole country 
  * a robust and new way to manage parking lots with time based system 


* first steps were to create a data base :
   * used an azure server to implement a MySQL data base 
     * we used UML language to desighn the strucure of the project (skelaton) that described a 3 tier system :
      * Entity : holds all the data of an entity 
      * Control : holds all function that are communication based 
      * Boundary : A Gui for each user
